# Fitnessmagazine.com-Kodluyoruz
## Kodluyoruz first week assignment.

### I used HTML/CSS only, the few fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), icons from [Icons DB](https://www.iconsdb.com/) and online basically. The images are from the [template](https://dribbble.com/shots/8502411-Fitnessmagazine-com-Article-Page/attachments/793527?mode=media) which I attempted to duplicate, the grey background image was made in photoshop.
 
### Technologies used: HTML semantics elements, CSS varibales, media queries, flex and grid.
